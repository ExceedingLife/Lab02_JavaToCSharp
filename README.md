1 Description
Write a class named RetailItem that holds data about an item in a retail store. 
The class should have the following ﬁelds: 
• description: A String object that holds a brief description of the item 
• unitsOnHand: An int that holds the number of units currently in inventory 
• price: A double that holds the item’s retail price 
Write appropriate mutator methods that store values in these ﬁelds and accessor methods 
that return the values in these ﬁelds. Once you have written the class, write another 
class named RetailItemDemo that demonstrates the RetailItem class. The program that 
demonstrates the RetailItem class should be saved in a ﬁle named RetailItemDemo and it 
should creates three RetailItem objects and stores the following data in them:

Units On Hand

Item #1 Jacket 12 59.95 
Item #2 Designer Jeans 40 34.95
